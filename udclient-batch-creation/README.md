Batch Creation Scripts
==============

These are groovy scripts which will create a bunch of whatever objects you want. They may assume that udclient.sh is in the parent directory. Not currently in great condition to be nicely reused - I just wrote these up a few weeks ago and used them once. But someone else could use this as a starting point for something more polished. (And jettison jar needs to be on the classpath)
